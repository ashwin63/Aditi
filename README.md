Note: This project is done in collaboration with Anna University College of Engineering Guindy IST department and NGO Vidhyasagar under the guidance of Professor Dr. Bama as a part of Summer internship 2018 as a part of initiative 'Computing for everyone'.
This was built as a web application, however we have provided the means for the NGO to easily utilize this as a desktop application using Tomcat server. The application is built to be easily scalable into a completely distributed web application keeping in mind of distributed systems issus and concurrency handling.
